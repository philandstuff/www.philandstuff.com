title: Sneakily throwing checked exceptions

<p>I was reading the Clojure source code the other day when I noticed
this curious snippet in
<a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/LispReader.java">LispReader.java</a>:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="directive">static</span> <span class="directive">public</span> <span class="type">int</span> read1(<span class="predefined-type">Reader</span> r){
    <span class="keyword">try</span>
        {
        <span class="keyword">return</span> r.read();
        }
    <span class="keyword">catch</span>(<span class="exception">IOException</span> e)
        {
        <span class="keyword">throw</span> <span class="predefined-type">Util</span>.sneakyThrow(e);
        }
}</pre></div>
</div>


<p>I immediately thought to myself: &ldquo;what does <code>sneakyThrow</code> do?&rdquo; It
looks like it is a magic way to throw a checked exception without
needing a <code>throws</code> declaration. But how does it work?</p>

<p>First, a little background. Checked exceptions are effectively a
static analysis tool: there are no runtime checks on checked
exceptions. Rather, <code>javac</code> will refuse to compile code where a
checked exception is thrown with no <code>catch</code> block to catch it nor
<code>throws</code> declaration to declare its propagation.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s
<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/javaqa/2003-02/02-qa-0228-evilthrow.html?page=2">possible to throw a checked exception</a>
using bytecode manipulation, or Thread.stop(Throwable), and these
techniques have been known for at least a decade. However bytecode
manipulation is messy, and Thread.stop(Throwable) has been deprecated
for at least a decade too. Is there a pure-Java way to throw a checked
exception sneakily?</p>

<p>C-family languages normally provide typecasts, a trapdoor to escape
their static typing system when you think it is more hindrance than
help. So a first attempt might go something like <code>throw
(RuntimeException) e;</code>. However if you try this in the above code, you
will get a <code>ClassCastException</code> at runtime, because <code>IOException</code> is
not an instance of <code>RuntimeException</code>. It would seem that there is no
pure-Java way to throw a checked exception.</p>

<p>So how does <code>sneakyThrow</code> work? Here it is, in all its glory:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="comment">/**
 * Throw even checked exceptions without being required
 * to declare them or catch them. Suggested idiom:
 * throw sneakyThrow( some exception );
 */</span>
<span class="directive">static</span> <span class="directive">public</span> <span class="exception">RuntimeException</span> sneakyThrow(<span class="predefined-type">Throwable</span> t) {
    <span class="comment">// http://www.mail-archive.com/javaposse@googlegroups.com/msg05984.html</span>
    <span class="keyword">if</span> (t == <span class="predefined-constant">null</span>)
        <span class="keyword">throw</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="exception">NullPointerException</span>();
    <span class="predefined-type">Util</span>.sneakyThrow0(t);
    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="predefined-constant">null</span>;
}

<span class="annotation">@SuppressWarnings</span>(<span class="string"><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span><span class="content">unchecked</span><span class="delimiter">&quot;</span></span>)
<span class="directive">static</span> <span class="directive">private</span>  <span class="type">void</span> sneakyThrow0(<span class="predefined-type">Throwable</span> t) <span class="directive">throws</span> T {
    <span class="keyword">throw</span> (T) t;
}</pre></div>
</div>


<p>That
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/javaposse@googlegroups.com/msg05984.html">link</a>
in the comments gives credit to Reinier Zwitserloot who, as far as I
know, had the first mention of this technique in 2009 on the java
posse mailing list.</p>

<p>What we have here is a severe abuse of Java. Util.sneakyThrow(t) calls
Util.sneakyThrow0; then within sneakyThrow0() we
cast to the parameterized type <code>T</code>. In this case that type is
<code>RuntimeException</code>. At runtime, however, the generic types have been
erased, so that there is no <code>T</code> type anymore to cast to, so the cast
disappears.</p>

<p>In other words, we&rsquo;ve managed to convince the compiler and the runtime
that they&rsquo;re seeing different things. The compiler sees the code with
the cast:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>throw (RuntimeException) t;</pre></div>
</div>


<p>so it allows the now-unchecked exception to propagate. The runtime
doesn&rsquo;t see the generic types, so it sees no cast:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>throw t;</pre></div>
</div>


<p>and therefore it doesn&rsquo;t complain about a <code>ClassCastException</code>.</p>

<p>There was one last nagging thought I had about the original code:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>throw Util.sneakyThrow(e);</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Given that Util.sneakyThrow(e) throws the exception itself, why does
the calling code also use <code>throw</code>? The answer is, once more, to make
the compiler happy. Without the <code>throw</code>, the compiler will demand a
<code>return</code> statement afterwards.</p>

<hr />

<p>Reinier Zwitserloot added this functionality to
<a href="http://projectlombok.org/index.html">Project Lombok</a> as the
<a href="http://projectlombok.org/features/SneakyThrows.html"><code>@SneakyThrows</code></a>
annotation, so now you can propagate checked exceptions sneakily with
minimal boilerplate. The @SneakyThrows page also summarizes neatly
some use-cases for why you would ever actually want to throw a checked
exception:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are calling a method which literally can never throw the
exception that it declares. The example given is <code>new
String(someByteArray, "UTF-8")</code>, which declares that it throws
UnsupportedEncodingException but UTF-8 is guaranteed by the Java
spec to always be present.</li>
<li>You are implementing a strict interface where you don&rsquo;t have the
option for adding a <code>throws</code> declaration, and yet throwing an
exception is entirely appropriate &mdash; the canonical example is
Runnable.run(), which does not throw any checked exceptions.</li>
</ul>


<p>The first case is clear &mdash; the <code>throws</code> declaration is a nuisance and
any solution to silence it with minimal boilerplate is welcome.</p>

<p>The second case has one common alternative: wrapping the checked
exception in a RuntimeException so that you can throw it. Both
approaches will have their critics. Wrapping an exception just to gain
the privelege of throwing it results in a stacktrace with spurious
exceptions which contribute no information about what actually went
wrong. On the other hand, throwing checked exceptions may violate the
principle of least surprise; it will no longer be enough to catch
<code>RuntimeException</code> to be able to guarantee catching all possible
exceptions.</p>

<p>It will be up to any given project to decide which is the lesser of
two evils and establish a standard on their codebase.</p>
